Ah plans, aren't they great?

Ah damn fuck the plan  

I hate plans... I've ended up being rubbish at planning things. I think it could be an apathatic thing, not *really* caring about a lot of things and being able to adapt to something quickly-ish (at least outwardly...)

I think, if I had my way, I'd remove all the need for planning and just do whatever I need to do on a whim. The issue seems to come up when it has an effect on someone else... What if they deal with life by planning everything to the smallest detail? Well, I guess I just let them plan and don't put any effort into that... They then get frustrated that it appears that I don't care (which is sometimes true) and that I'm not putting any thought into *life*. 

I know that's not the case, I do care about things, I just don't want to deal with them until I *really* have to. When the deadline is in a couple of hours and I can't be distracted by anything else, I'm brilliant at planning! It's planning for the next 5 mins for getting the thing that I didn't originally plan for done... I'd still argue that's planning. So maybe I'm so good at planning I don't need to do it until the problem *actually* needs fixing right away(?) yay!
