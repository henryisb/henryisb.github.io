title: What is this for?
---

I'm not sure exactly why this has been created...

I'm thinking of starting some form of blog, but at this point in time, I've not come up with a good enough reason to.

I've written a couple of Haikus (haiku's, Haiku's, haikus? One of the above...) and wanted them to be in some public place. This might just be the ramblings of a slightly unhinged human being, but I doubt anyone's going to be reading it.

(I thought I'd make them rhyme on the request of someone I work with. Future haikus/poems/whatever aren't going to be constrained by their needs... Or they might be, I'm not sure)

h4. Deployment haiku
The deployment's done,
Now, shall we have all the fun,
Or maybe a run

h4. Fun haiku
How to define fun?
Temporal snapshot of life?
Maybe emptiness...
