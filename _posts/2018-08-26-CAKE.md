CAKE!

Mmmm cake! Currently (haha it would have been great if it was a currant cake, then I could have said Currantly instead... That would've been great...) I'm sat eating a delicious lemon drizzle cake in the middle of the countryside (okay, not in the middle, but in a pretty rural spot) and I'm ruddy loving it! 

Cake is so delish  
As I chomp it down squish squish  
In my tummy now
