Is there much better than just a rambling stream of consciousness?

There's something rather satisfying about just rambling on from what's going on in your head... I feel like sometimes I don't get that kind of thing out of my head. I love writing in my little book (again always rambling consciousness) but I don't do it as often as ~~I want to (?)~~ (I'm not even sure that's true...) as I think I want to. It's only really during trips to coffee shops or when I'm by myself in a relaxing environment that I feel the need to get that stuff out or just stream out the   consciousness even if it doesn't *need* to come out.  

I'm not sure why I'm writing this... I'm actually at work... Maybe I'll get back to something else.
