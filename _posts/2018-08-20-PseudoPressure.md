title: Pseudo-pressure
---

I'm not sure if this is real pressure...  
How are you meant to tell if it's real pressure and you enjoy that feeling or if it's just a tame environment and real pressure only exists elsewhere? I feel like I don't get particularly "stressed" at work... In the sense that I cope pretty well with it all (possibly with a mask(?) on...) and don't take it home with me in a painful way. Obviously I don't forget about it entirely and things come to me at home that help me understand/process/solve problems at work, but it doesn't consume me in the way I hear others talking about it.

So am I not in the right job? Maybe I should do something that fully consumes me... Actually, that sounds pretty horrible. I could just be a lazy human being... That does seem rather likely, I'm always for the path of least resistance.

Is this pressure true  
It doesn't feel quite real  
Maybe I don't care

I'm not too worried  
About some aspects of life  
But some cripple me
